I am a career changer Junior Software Engineer with a background in the arts sector. I recently spent an amazing 16 weeks on the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp learning to be a full stack engineer. In those 16 weeks I went from knowing some basic Ruby and JavaScript, to conceptualising and delivering a full stack, test driven, React website, using multiple APIs and working in a team.

My career in the arts and charitable sectors has revolved around fundraising and relationship building. I loved working in the industry and doing work that helped people, however, as I learnt more about myself, I realised that I craved a career that would enable me to problem solve, apply logical and pragmatic thinking, and make cool things.

Outside of work, I am a musician and co-lead the viola section of the Cambridge Philharmonic Orchestra. I'm also really into running, stand up paddle boarding, and going on aimless rambles by myself. I practice yoga and meditation, and love being outdoors. I also run a small macrame tapestry business, Macramazing!
